The University's union's acting president Ken Woo Kwok-wang responded saying "In his speech, he said we should embrace diversity and different views. But as our university's president, he could not accept different views from the graduates". |
| Emerson College | 2019-10-26 | Frances Hui posted an op-ed she had written, titled "I Am From Hong Kong, Not China", to which students from China responded with death threats, such as "Whomever opposes my greatest China, no matter how far they are, must be executed." Ms. Hui said an administrator had reached out to make sure she felt safe. But when she requested a public statement condemning the threats against her, none came. Ms. Hui responded "I understand that the school doesn't want to take a political stance, but you certainly shouldn't stand for students who make threatening statements and hateful comments." Lee Pelton, president of Emerson College warned that school administrators needed to have "global competency" or risk the kind of firestorm that enveloped the National Basketball Association this month over a pro-Hong Kong tweet from Daryl Morey. |
| Eastman Philharmonia | 2019-10-24 | The Eastman Philharmonia is due to tour eight cities in China over 12 days in December. But not the whole orchestra.

| Maserati / Fiat Chrysler | 2019-10-23 | Maserati cut ties with the Golden Horse Awards, a festival held in Taiwan that is billed as Asia's equivalent of Hollywood's Academy Awards.

I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with ... with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke." He later attempted to defend his statement by saying "My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it." LeBron James has previously said that "-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50" and "It's important that we as athletes continue to use the platform we have to speak up for what we believe in". |

This issue is non-negotiable." |
