# 2019 Hong Kong protests

The **2019 Hong Kong protests**, also known as the **Anti–Extradition Law Amendment Bill** or **Anti-ELAB movement**, are an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong which began with the aim to oppose the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and China. People were concerned that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to Chinese jurisdiction, undermining the autonomy of the region and its civil liberties. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands:

~~1. **Full withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process**~~
2. **Retraction of the characterisation of the protests as "riots"**
3. **Release and exoneration of arrested protesters**
4. **Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police behaviour**
5. **Universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections**

On October 23, Secretary John Lee officially withdrew the bill. Chan Tong-kai, the murder suspect that prompted the HKSAR government to propose the bill, was released from prison on the same day.

Demonstrations against the bill began in March and April and turned into continuing mass movements in June. June 9 saw the first ever use of artificial intelligence in measuring protesting crowds in the history of Hong Kong and 517,478 people were identified as they marched for the withdrawal of the bill. A day later, Chief Executive Carrie Lam vowed to push ahead with the extradition bill despite huge protests. On June 12, the day on which the bill was scheduled for a second reading in the Legislative Council, the protests showed a sharp escalation in violence. Riot police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets, but protesters successfully stalled the functioning of the legislature. An even bigger march took place on June 16, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters shifted the focus into the alleged excessive use of force by the police on June 12. A scholar on-field gave an independent estimate of 500,000 to 800,000 protesters, while the organisers claimed that two million people participated.

July 1 marked the storming of the Legislative Council Complex and the vandalisation of central government symbols there. Subsequently, the protests have continued throughout the summer, escalating into increasingly violent confrontations involving the police, activists on both sides, suspected triad gangs, and local residents in all districts throughout the region. July 21 marked the Yuen Long attack where triads assaulted protesters and bystanders all night long, while police were accused of collusion by their intentional slow action.

Subsequent police operations and alleged misconduct prompted a general strike and city-wide protests on August 5. About 1.7 million people (organisers' estimate) also attended a rally condemning police brutality on August 18. Inspired by the Baltic Way, a human chain 50 kilometres long created the Hong Kong Way. There were also pro-police rallies that attracted hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents.

Lam suspended the extradition bill on June 15 and declared the bill "dead" on July 9, but fell short of a promise to withdraw it until September 4. However, she refused to concede to any of the other four demands. It should also be noted that the bill has yet to see complete withdrawal.

Large-scale demonstrations occurred on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, with an 18-year-old student protester shot by police on October 1. Attempting to curb protests, the Chief Executive in Council invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance on October 4 to implement an anti-mask law. Effective October 5, 2019, offenders risk one year imprisonment or a fine of HK$25,000. An application for judicial injunction of the anti-mask law was denied by court on the same night shortly before the new regulation took effect.

## Tactics and methods

The 2019 Hong Kong protests have been largely described as "leaderless". No group or political party has claimed leadership over the movement. They mainly played a supportive role, such as applying for Letters of No Objection from the police or mediating conflicts between protesters and police officers. Protesters commonly used LIHKG, an online forum similar to Reddit, and Telegram, an optionally end-to-end encrypted messaging service similar to Whatsapp, to communicate and brainstorm ideas for protests and make collective decisions.

Protesters also upheld several praxis. The first one was "be water", which originated from Bruce Lee's philosophy. Protesters often moved in a mobile and agile fashion so that the police found it more difficult to respond. Protesters often retreated when the police arrived, though they would reemerge somewhere else. Unlike previous protests, the 2019 protests were diversified to over 20 different neighbourhoods throughout Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories witnessing protests. In addition, protesters adopted the black bloc method. They wore mostly black face masks to protect their identities. Furthermore, protesters used a range of methods to counter the police force. They used laser pointers to distract police officers, sprayed paint on surveillance cameras, and unfurled umbrellas to protect and conceal the identities of the group in action.

There are mainly two groups of protesters, namely the "peaceful, rational and non-violent" (Chinese: 和理非) protesters and the "fighters" group (Chinese: 勇武). The "peaceful group" participated chanted slogans and sang songs such as "Glory to Hong Kong". Some of them volunteered as medics, started hunger strikes, formed human chains, started petition campaigns, organised general strikes, obstructed public transport services, launched boycotts against pro-Beijing shops and organisations, create derivative works mocking the police and the government, and set up Lennon Walls in various districts and neighbourhoods in Hong Kong. On the other hand, the more radical protesters confronted the police, besieged police stations, set up roadblocks, sometimes committed vandalism such as damaging MTR stations and pro-Beijing shops, defacing symbols representing China, committing arson by throwing petrol bombs, and taking justice into own hands by beating perceived "hostile" opponents who were disrupting them as they became wary and distrustful toward the police as a law enforcement agency. Some protesters also doxxed and cyberbullied police officers and their families and uploaded their personal information online. Nonetheless, despite difference in methods, both groups have refrained from denouncing or criticising the other. The principle was the "Do Not Split" praxis, which was aimed to promote mutual respect for different views within the same protest movement.

To raise awareness of their demands, some protesters have also raised funds to place advertisements in major international newspapers, and waved the American Star-Spangled Banner and the British Union Jack as a sign of support for the United States of America and the United Kingdom respectively as well as singing the titular anthem of the former, and the national anthem of the latter. They also organised press conferences to "broadcast under-represented voices" and their own perspectives to the public to counter the police's and the government's conferences. Protesters also attempted to inform tourists about the protests of Hong Kong by staging sit-ins at Hong Kong International Airport and using Apple devices' AirDrop feature to broadcast anti-extradition bill information to the public and mainland tourists. Pepe the Frog has been widely used as a symbol of liberty and resistance, and the #Eye4HK campaign, which showed solidarity for a female whose eye was ruptured with a beanbag shot by the police, gained international momentum around the world.


## Suicides

There were eight[ suicide cases linked to the anti-extradition bill protests. In five suicide cases, the victims left suicide notes citing the bill as the reason they took their lives and three were be attributed to events that follow the extradition bill. One note even stated: "What Hong Kong needs is a revolution."

The first suicide took place on 15 June, when 35-year-old Marco Leung Ling-kit climbed the elevated podium on the rooftop of Pacific Place, a shopping centre in Admiralty at 4:30 pm. Wearing a yellow raincoat with the words "Brutal police are cold-blooded" and "Carrie Lam is killing Hong Kong" in Chinese written on the back, he hung a banner on the scaffolding with several anti-extradition slogans. After a five-hour standoff, during which police officers and Democratic Party legislator Roy Kwong attempted to talk him down, Leung fell to his death, missing an inflatable cushion set up by firefighters.

A shrine appeared at the scene soon afterward; Ai Weiwei shared the news on his Instagram feed, while Chinese satirist Badiucao honoured the dead man with a cartoon. On Thursday 11 July another vigil was held, in which thousands turned up leaving sunflowers at the memorial site. Artists in Prague have also honoured the event, and painted a memorial on the Lennon Wall in the Czech Republic, depicting a yellow raincoat along with words of well wishes.

A 21-year-old Education University of Hong Kong student, Lo Hiu-yan, jumped to her death from Ka Fuk Estate in Fanling on 29 June. She had left two notes written on a stairwell wall with red marker, and uploaded photos of her note to Instagram. A third suicide occurred the next day when a 29-year-old woman, Zhita Wu, jumped from the International Financial Centre. On 4 July, a 28-year-old woman only identified by the surname Mak died after jumping off a building in Cheung Sha Wan. A fifth suicide occurred on 22 July, when a 26-year-old man identified by the surname Fan died after jumping from Kwong Yuen Estate after an argument with his parents about his political stance and being driven from the house. Neighbours of Fan left flowers near the site. 

While 8 suicide cases were directly linked t othe anti-extradition bill protests, it's very important to note that total number of suicides since the protests began has exceeded 100. So many suicide cases in just a few months is unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. These so-called suicide cases were either through jumping off high-rise buildings or by drowning. A fireboat operator wrote on a social media post that he had worked on fireboats for more than a decade, and the number of corpses he recovered in the past several months is as high as the total number from the past ten years.

In addition, there are many questionable details in these suicide cases as reported by various media outlets. For example, several victims who fell from tall buildings did not bleed but displayed past injuries on their corpses. One victim who had supposedly "drowned" was found with his hands bound together. Another victim whose body was found floating in the bay across Tsuen Wan had his mouth covered with tape, and it appeared that he did not die from drowning as his body was not bloated. In another horrific case, a naked woman fell from a tall building and it seemed her body had already been severed at the waist.

Many believe that these people were murdered before they were thrown into a river or thrown off a building. Most notably, the number of unusual suicide cases increased drastically after police raided the Prince Edward station on Aug. 31. It is widely believed that among the more than 100 suicide cases, only a few individuals actually committed suicide, whereas the majority were murders disguised as suicides.

One particular death caught international media attention. The death of the 15 year old protestor, Chan Yin-lam, a competitive swimmer whose corpse was found floating naked in the river. Police classified the case as a suicide and not suspicious. Her body was cremated a day after being identified to be Chan Yin-lam.


## Police misconduct

During the protests, the Hong Kong Police Force have been widely accused of misconduct. The Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties. Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and had allegedly claimed that she would not "betray" the Force.

Hong Kong police are accused of using excessive and disproportionate force, such as using rubber bullets dangerously by aiming horizontally, targeting the heads and torsos of protesters. Its use of bean bag rounds ruptured the eye of a female medic protester, and the police's use of pepper ball rounds in Tai Koo station was described as "execution-styled shooting". Its use of tear gas is criticised for violating the international safety guidelines, as the police were found using it as an offensive weapon, firing it indoors in Kwai Fong station, and using expired tear gas, which may release toxic gases such as phosgene and cyanide upon combustion according to academics. Its usage in densely populated residential areas also attracted criticisms from affected residents. Several police operations, in particular in Prince Edward station, where the STS assaulted commuters on a train, were thought to have disregarded public safety by protesters and pro-democrats. The police was accused of using disproportionate force after an officer had shot a young protester with live ammunition on 1 October. The police defended the officer's actions, saying that the officer and his colleague's lives were at risk as a group of protesters was assaulting another officer at the time. Protesters argued that the officer need not to shoot the man's chest and that he had other less lethal alternative weapon at his disposal.

The kettling of protesters in CITIC Tower and New Town Plaza, the operations inside private areas, the deployment of undercover officers, the tampering with evidence, the denial of first-aid services for the wounded, and how the police displayed their warning signs are also controversial. As police officers does not wear uniforms with identification numbers or fail to display their warrant cards, it is difficult for citizens to file complaints. Police are also accused of using excessive force on already subdued, unresisting arrestees, and is criticised for using one of them as a human shield. Amnesty International had stated that the police had used "retaliatory violence" against protesters and have mistreated and tortured some of the detainees. It is also accused of using sexual violence on female protesters. Some detainees reported that the police had denied them access to lawyers. Many of these allegations are believed to have taken place in San Uk Ling Holding Centre.

The police are accused of interfering with press freedom and injuring journalists during various protests, permanently blinding the right eye of an Indonesian journalist. The police is also accused of spreading a climate of fear by conducting hospital arrests, arresting people arbitrarily, banning requests for demonstrations, and arresting high-profile activists and lawmakers. Some bystanders caught up in the protests are beaten up or kicked by officers. Its inaction during the storming of the Legislative Council Complex was divisive. Its slow response towards the Yuen Long and North Point attacks sparked accusations that the police had colluded with triad members. Some lawyers have pointed out that their refusal to help the victims as they shut the gates of the nearby police stations during the Yuen Long attacks might be an offence of misconduct in public office. A police officer describing a man wearing a yellow vest being kicked by an officer as a "yellow object" was widely criticised.

The personal conduct of some officers is also criticised. Some uniformed officers use foul language to harass and humiliate protesters and journalists, and some officers are accused of modifying their weapon, provoking the protesters, and grinning while using force. The Junior Police Officers' Association also use the controversial term "cockroaches" to describe the radical subset of protesters. The police is also accused of upholding a "double standard" by showing leniency towards violent counter-protesters. The police have denied all of these accusations, however, all the accusations are supported through countless video recordings.

For instance, a pro-China taxi driver, Harry Cheng, committed a terrorist attack by ramming his car into a crowd of pro-democracy protesters. This resulted in an innocent 23-year-old woman, Ms Yau, having her thigh bones shattered, with reports indicating she is not guaranteed to be able to walk again. Hong Kong police documented the event as an act of "rioting" on behalf of the protesters and dismissed accusations that he deliberately drove his car into the crowd. Harry Cheng told reporters "I have a clear conscience. I never received money for deliberately ramming my vehicle into the protesters." A pro-communist group organized by Chinese officials awarded Harry Cheng HK$520,000 for his terrorist attack.

The Chinese government has through their censorship and mischaracterization of the protestors managed to turn Chinese people against the Hong Kong citizens. They are also encouraging both the Hong Kong Police Force and Chinese citizens to use violence against the protestors with little to no risk of punishment for doing so. On October 19, a Chinese citizen, visited Hong Kong on a tourist visa, during which he stabbed a man in the neck and stomach for distributing fliers in Taipo. The stab in his abdomen was so deep that his guts were spilling out. The case is still ongoing, but considering the HKPF leniency towards those who attack the protestors, then it's highly unlikely that he will be charged with attempted murder. It also remain unclear if the victim will survive.

In 1962, John F. Kennedy famously said, "**Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.**" The Chinese and Hong Kong governments', along with the Hong Kong Police Force, are making it impossible for the Hong Kong people to peacefully protest. It's important to understand that the Hong Kong people are not just fighting for their own freedom and democracy, they are also fighting for the people in China, as well as the rest of the world.
